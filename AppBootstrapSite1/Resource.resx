    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>Born: Sheikh Abdur Razzak Bin Yusuf was born in a religious family of Hajirtala village under Maunga box under Devinagar upazila of Chapainawabganj district of northern Bangladesh.

Studying: After studying Maktab in the field of education, he read from Nawabganj Nawabganj Madrasa, one of the books of Hadith, Mishkat Sharif. Then he went to India hoping for higher education and finished Daura Hadith from Darul Ulum Maunathwangan in Uttar Pradesh. He ended the two-day tradition of Dora. Then he returned to the country and took part in the Fazil and Kamil examinations. He passed Kamil in 1st Division with hadith and tafsir.

He started his career by working as a teacher in Al-Marakazul Islami in Jannatpur, Gobindaganj, Gaibandha. Then since 1998, Al-Makarajul Islami As Salafi Noadapara has been serving as a Muhaddis in Rajshahi. He has also served as head teacher in Madras for nearly 5 years. In these five years Madrasah has kept a great deal of success in improving the answer. Besides, he also served as a member of the fatwa board of the monthly At Tahir. At present, he is also managing an organization named Al Jamiatus Salafia.

Din Khidmat: As a student, he used to give a speech from the life of the people, besides giving Daras to him, he was invited to the religion through speech. And now he is recognized as a well-known speaker among Bangla speaking scholars. He also gave regular lectures on Dr. Zakir Naik's Piece TV. He has so far participated in various programs in Saudi Arabia, Dubai, India and the Maldives. The interesting feature of his statement is that he recited the Arabic ebat of Hadith and then translated it. His two-and-a-half thousand hadiths were memorized. He spoke for two or three hours on different subjects, but he did not find any place other than translations of Hadith and Hadith. As a result, each of his statements is one of the Daras Hadith.

He has contributed less than his contribution to the field of writing, so far he has written about ten books. In the meantime, one of the rules is the prayer of the Prophet's Prayer and the Tauzieh al-Quran. Many of his students, who are now in his hand, are now offering the daily sacrifice of the people like Shaikh Muzaffer bin Mohsin, Shaikh Imamuddin bin Abdul Bassi, Shaikh Nurul Islam, Shaikh Abu Taher, Shaikh Abdul Matin Madani, Shaikh Shariful Islam Madani. Besides, there are thousands of people on the verge of Bengal who have repented from all the sins committed by al-Hamdulillah. There are many such young people who, after listening to Shaykh, gave up wearing pants under ankle, and kept the sunnati beard in their mouth. It is to be noted that one of the characteristics of Shaykh's statement is that he gave a special statement to the Muslims regardless of the madhhab and maslak. Especially in regards to Paradise, Hell, Quayamat, ideal family, who have suffered a great loss, etc. Maslak was able to stir the heart of all Muslims irrespective of religion. In order to spread Islamic education in Bangladesh, he established many institutions such as Al-Jamaiatus Salafia, Rupganj Narayanganj, Al Madrasaatus Salafia, Atmal, Bogra, Birkustiya Darul Hadith Salafia Madrasah Bogra. And assist many organizations to move forward. Such as Al-Marqajul Islami As Salafis, Rajshahi and Sallafia Madrasah, Rajshahi.

Honorable readers!
You are aware that since August 2013, Shaykh Abdur Razzaq bin Yusuf has managed to establish Al-Jami'ah as Salafiyyah for the purpose of preparing algebraic scholars in harmony with the Holy Quran and Chhih Hadeeth as well as modern education.
Within a year of the establishment of Jami'ah Salafiyah, with the help of the great God, we have been able to construct residential buildings of three-storeyed students, which have 10 rooms with 18/20 feet below the floor. And 4 rooms of 15/20 feet brick walls have been built for the students. Falilahil Hamd At present, there are 118 students, 10 teachers, four employees and 31 students, 5 teachers and 1 staff in the department of students in this organization. In the first year of his establishment, Jami'ah Salafiah achieved the 100% A Plus success in the closing examination of the 5th grade in 2014. Presently Darshan Bukhari open to everyone in this organization is being held regularly for every month. Falilahil Hamd
