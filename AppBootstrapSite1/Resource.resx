    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

Honorable readers!
You are aware that since August 2013, Shaykh Abdur Razzaq bin Yusuf has managed to establish Al-Jami'ah as Salafiyyah for the purpose of preparing algebraic scholars in harmony with the Holy Quran and Chhih Hadeeth as well as modern education.
Within a year of the establishment of Jami'ah Salafiyah, with the help of the great God, we have been able to construct residential buildings of three-storeyed students, which have 10 rooms with 18/20 feet below the floor. And 4 rooms of 15/20 feet brick walls have been built for the students. Falilahil Hamd At present, there are 118 students, 10 teachers, four employees and 31 students, 5 teachers and 1 staff in the department of students in this organization. In the first year of his establishment, Jami'ah Salafiah achieved the 100% A Plus success in the closing examination of the 5th grade in 2014. Presently Darshan Bukhari open to everyone in this organization is being held regularly for every month. Falilahil Hamd
Current cost: For your reference, it is being informed that at present, the salary and salary of teachers and employees is Rs 1,468,000 per month. And the cost of eating some poor boys, including eight orphans, costs around 60,000 rupees per month.
Future plan:
It is very important to take some of our work steps for the organization's needs. That's why we want to put things in a hurry,
A 1-5-storey residential residential building. The cost of construction of 1st floor is approximately 40 lakhs.
2- Construction of residential building of a 5th floor building with two units.
3- Construction of a 5-storey mosque with nine thousand square feet. The construction of the first floor will cost around one and a half million.
4- Establishment of a quality libraries and laboratories.

Expand your donation arm like this in the past to reach its target educational institution. InshaAllah Allah will give you a better reward.</value>
