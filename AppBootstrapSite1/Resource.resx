    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

He has memorized so many Hadeeths that people become astonished at his continuous recitation and translation from Hadith. In his two to three-hour speech on certain subjects (topic), there is no place other than Hadeeth and the verses from the Quran.

Besides, many people from different parts of the world have come back from their sinful ways and repented of their offensive activities and many such young people gave up wearing pants below the ankle and kept the Sunnati beard after listening to his speech. After this, he focused on establishing the religious educational institution to create Islamic scholars and researchers. He has established a number of religious educational institutions, such as al-Jamiah As-Salafiyah, Narayanganj; Al-Jamiah As-Salafiyah, Dangipara, Rajshahi; Women Salafiyah Madrasah, Rajshahi; Al-Madrasatus Salafiyah, Bogra and Birkusta Darul Hadeeth Salafiyah Madrasah, Bogra. He also supports many organizations so that they can be developed. For example, Al-Makarajul Islami As-Salafi, Rajshahi. We pray that, “May Allah bless and make Shaykh live-long. Amin!

    <value>(a) The history of Al Jamiah As Salafiah, Narayanganj: A Furkania Madrasha (Religious School) was established in 1954 by the effort of the famous physician Doctor Abdus Subhan in association of some Islam loving brothers because there were no institutions for learning the Holy Quran in that area of Birhatabo, Rupganj, Narayanganj. Afterwards the institution’s name was changed as  Amdia Krishak-Sramik Hafizia Madrasha. Due to financial crisis, the institution was closed in 1996. After five long years, in 2001, the activities of the institution restarted. After five years the activities of the institution again got closed due to same reason. But the founder and secretary, Mr. Dr. Abdus Subhan began to search for an Islamic personality who, being an active server, would build up the institution as a world-class one. One day he got introduced to Shaykh Abdur Razzak Bin Yousuf. He came in this area to deliver his speech in an Islamic Conference on 5th July 2013. That time he passed the night in the residence of Mr. Mugal Mia, son of Mr. Musharaf in Deboi village. In the morning, around 6.30 am to 7.00 am, Mr. Dr. Abdus-Subhan met him and proposed to hand over the institution to him. Taking a few days, Shaykh Abdur Razzak Bin Yousuf prayed to the Almighty Allah for help and after consulting with some of the scholars, agreed to accept the proposal to take the responsibility of the Managing Director. After that, he conducted a meeting in 29th July 2013, in the presence of Guljar master. Then he decided to set up an institution (Islamic school). In 2013, 28th April, the name of the institution was changed as Al Jamiah As Salafiah. In 2013, 28th August, Tuesday at 11 am the institution was inaugurated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     (b) The History of Al Jamiah As Salafiah, Rajshahi: "From the very beginning, the activities of the Maktab were going on upon the donations of Mr. Akkas Ali Mullah, dweller of South Dangipara, for the purpose of spreading Islamic studies among the children in Dangipara Jame Mosque. In 2008, 26th November, an Imam was appointed at the mosque and he started to teach the children according to the new curriculum, which means according to Tajweed with Holy Quran from 28th November 2008. As a result, the number of the students began to increase who used to come from nearest villages- Birasthoil, Panishail and so on. The number of the students increased so rapidly that some of the students had to go-back home for not getting any seats. Realizing the fact, Mr. Akkas Ali Mullah appointed one more teacher. After that, the educational activities were going on perfectly. In this way, one year passed. Then Mr. Akkas Ali Mullah proposed the Imam to establish a Madrasha in Dangipara in November 2005. The Imam assured him saying “In-Sha-Allah, the Madrasha would continue very well.” After that, in December 2005, he established an institution, named Dangipara Misbahul Ulum Ebtedaye Madrasha on the 73 decimal land donated by him, his mother, his brother and some others’. Then the Madrasha started its journey with 50 students from class one to class three. The institution continued to run as Dangipara Misbahul Ulum Ebtedaye Madrasha till 16th February 2016.
The cause of taking responsibility of this institution by Shaiekh Abdur Razzaq Bin Yousuf: Shaykh Abdur Razzak Bin Yousuf was appointed on 1st September 1997 as a Muhaddis in Markajul Islami Salafi, Nowda Para, Rajshahi. Among the teachers of the male section, he was the best teacher of Al-Markajul Islami As-Salafia. His prosperity and acceptance to the teachers and students began to increase day by day. So, the teachers and the students of the institution wanted him to be the Principal from the deepest corner of their hearts. Because the educational activities were being hampered for the want of a competent Principal- and the administrative condition was also going through chaos.
In this situation, the authority of Markaz appointed him as the Principal in charge in 2009. As a result, Markaz got back its proper environment for study. The standard of education, the standard of eating in boarding and the standard of the infrastructure of the buildings began to increase. At last, he was appointed as the Principal in 2012 permanently. His wife, Razia Begum was the Principal of female branch. Both the husband and the wife used to work hard for the welfare of the institution. Despite their working hard, they were suspended from their professions in 17th December 2015. At that time, both of them were worried about their life. They were hesitated whether they should establish a Madrasha in Rajshahi or they should move to Al Jamiah As Salafiah, Narayanganj. In the meantime, two persons came from Dangipara. They knew all the information of this incident and consoled him. They proposed him to build up a new Madrasha in Dangipara. Next day, three persons came to him and they also proposed him to build up a new Madrasha. At the third day, four persons came to him and they too proposed him with emphasis to build up a new Madrasha. Then he took time for some days to seek help from the Almighty Allah and he consulted the fact with some scholars. Finally, he agreed to establish a new Madrasha at Dangipara, Paba, in Rajshahi. And by their agreement the name of Dangipara Misbahul Ulum Ebtedaye Madrasha was changed into Al-Jamiah As-Salafiah on Wednesday in 17th February 2016. And It’s foundation was deployed by the grace of Allah Subhan-a-Ta-ala. It’s to be noted that the educational activities of this institution began with the Darsh from Bukhari at 7.00 am on Saturday of 16th July 2016.</value>

    <value>Born: Sheikh Abdur Razzak Bin Yusuf was born in a religious family of Hajirtala village under Maunga box under Devinagar upazila of Chapainawabganj district of northern Bangladesh.

Studying: After studying Maktab in the field of education, he read from Nawabganj Nawabganj Madrasa, one of the books of Hadith, Mishkat Sharif. Then he went to India hoping for higher education and finished Daura Hadith from Darul Ulum Maunathwangan in Uttar Pradesh. He ended the two-day tradition of Dora. Then he returned to the country and took part in the Fazil and Kamil examinations. He passed Kamil in 1st Division with hadith and tafsir.

He started his career by working as a teacher in Al-Marakazul Islami in Jannatpur, Gobindaganj, Gaibandha. Then since 1998, Al-Makarajul Islami As Salafi Noadapara has been serving as a Muhaddis in Rajshahi. He has also served as head teacher in Madras for nearly 5 years. In these five years Madrasah has kept a great deal of success in improving the answer. Besides, he also served as a member of the fatwa board of the monthly At Tahir. At present, he is also managing an organization named Al Jamiatus Salafia.

Din Khidmat: As a student, he used to give a speech from the life of the people, besides giving Daras to him, he was invited to the religion through speech. And now he is recognized as a well-known speaker among Bangla speaking scholars. He also gave regular lectures on Dr. Zakir Naik's Piece TV. He has so far participated in various programs in Saudi Arabia, Dubai, India and the Maldives. The interesting feature of his statement is that he recited the Arabic ebat of Hadith and then translated it. His two-and-a-half thousand hadiths were memorized. He spoke for two or three hours on different subjects, but he did not find any place other than translations of Hadith and Hadith. As a result, each of his statements is one of the Daras Hadith.

He has contributed less than his contribution to the field of writing, so far he has written about ten books. In the meantime, one of the rules is the prayer of the Prophet's Prayer and the Tauzieh al-Quran. Many of his students, who are now in his hand, are now offering the daily sacrifice of the people like Shaikh Muzaffer bin Mohsin, Shaikh Imamuddin bin Abdul Bassi, Shaikh Nurul Islam, Shaikh Abu Taher, Shaikh Abdul Matin Madani, Shaikh Shariful Islam Madani. Besides, there are thousands of people on the verge of Bengal who have repented from all the sins committed by al-Hamdulillah. There are many such young people who, after listening to Shaykh, gave up wearing pants under ankle, and kept the sunnati beard in their mouth. It is to be noted that one of the characteristics of Shaykh's statement is that he gave a special statement to the Muslims regardless of the madhhab and maslak. Especially in regards to Paradise, Hell, Quayamat, ideal family, who have suffered a great loss, etc. Maslak was able to stir the heart of all Muslims irrespective of religion. In order to spread Islamic education in Bangladesh, he established many institutions such as Al-Jamaiatus Salafia, Rupganj Narayanganj, Al Madrasaatus Salafia, Atmal, Bogra, Birkustiya Darul Hadith Salafia Madrasah Bogra. And assist many organizations to move forward. Such as Al-Marqajul Islami As Salafis, Rajshahi and Sallafia Madrasah, Rajshahi.
